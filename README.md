ðŸŸ  Simple Neural Network Classification on make_circles (PyTorch)
This is my implementation of a basic neural network classifier for the classic make_circles dataset using PyTorch.
It's inspired by the tutorial "PyTorch for Deep Learning & Machine Learning â€“ Full Course" by Daniel Bourke.

The main purpose of this mini-project is to practice and understand:

- PyTorchâ€™s model and training loop (forward pass, loss, backward pass, optimizer step)
- Device management (cuda vs cpu)
- Saving and loading model weights
- Basic decision boundary visualization for classification tasks

Key Concepts Practiced
- Using sklearn.datasets.make_circles for toy binary classification
- Building a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with ReLU activations in PyTorch
- Writing a custom training loop with accuracy tracking
- Visualizing model predictions with a decision boundary plot
- Saving and reloading model weights with torch.save and torch.load
